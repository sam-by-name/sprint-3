What is you site's primary purpose?

Well, outside of the obvious, my site is my Gym and my playground, I go there to try testand<  experiment with new skills as I learn them.

Who is your target audience?

Any and all! 
But more specifically, other EDA students, walking a similar path. 
Teachers gauging my progression and understanding of the assignments and information laid outfor me.
Potential employers will likely become the more primary audience as time passes.
But it will also remain as the birthplace of my venture into the world of code.

It's on the internet, it's set to public ... it's in the wild now, so i shall try to bestcater for all.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to   have?

That seems an odd question considering our current, limited means of navigating websites, but as time goes on, I would like them to be able to do so with their eye's, voice and even contact-less gestures.
    
As for the experience I wish them to have, well initially this will be harder to implement.But ... I want that whether they arrived by accident or intent, that each visit is a uniqueand interesting one. If they arrived with questions, I wish to provide their answers, but alsoto have ones they didn't expect and for them to leave with new and unanswered questions.

A one stop shop,
My pet project shall not be,
The Universe is vast,
And thrives off of diversity.

So come one, come all,
A blast from the past,
Or views of the future,
Through the web we now see. 

Q. How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

Hmm, another tough cookie to crack, but my internal debugger is coming back with :
"What will be your starting process, in the creation of your desired end?".
I do hope my software isn't playing up as, for that is the question I shall answer.

To start off my journey towards the desired goal of an inspiring website, I shall first createsome insincere code :

1  First a quick meditate over the basic's of what my online presence is to contain and               convay.
2  Then to find some paper with which to play, a couple basic doodles. These poor drawings            shall be named "Wireframe" and "Boxified Concept", iteratively more complex and both               born into existence to the tic of noisy tomato.
3  Then and only then will my fingers first find the keys, through them the lattice like              framework shall form in a furious flurry of feisty finger flicks.
4  Browsed antics, reflecting reflection?
5  When the groundwork has been laid, the links to resourceful libraries shall be made. 
6  Now underway, some textual content to introduce and welcome shall display. 
7  In and around, the tags and commands find a home, bridges to a deeper more cryptic meaning         embellishments that color and shape our world, unseen by the layman, but imperative to a           worthy existence 
8  Rhyme and time now out the window, in comes the script, interesting verbal nonsense                beckons interaction on an unprecedented level, is it magic? or just work of the Devil 
9  Flying now, parallel dimensions? is that what I did just hear? Fine then, alternate                realities commenced ... to flesh out or just too be clear 
10 So much hath now transpired, time to put it to the test, does it work its best? A similar          view seen by all? 
11 If so, unleash int unto the wild, it's time for it to stand tall!
12 Is just more of 10 and 4, care, repair, additions but also occasions of dispair.
